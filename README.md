# From Exploration to Optimization: A Two-Phase Data Science Study on Heart Disease Data.
PHASE 1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Dimensionality Reduction.
Phase 1 Includes data cleaning, visualization, and unsupervised learning through dimensionality reduction using PCA.
Tasks of Phase-1 ->Task-1: Data Handling using Pandas,Task-2: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn,Task-3: Principal Component Analysis(PCA).

PHASE 2: Supervised Learning and Model Optimization.
Phase 2 Focuses on supervised learning with classification models, boosting algorithms, and hyperparameter tuning to evaluate and improve model performance.
Tasks of Phase-2 ->Task-4: Classification Model Comparison,Task-5: Boosting and Hyperparameter Tuning.

TASK-1:Data Handling using Pandas
OBJECTIVE:To explore and manipulate datasets using the Pandas library.
WORK DONE:I have taken a datasets that refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.
a)Loaded dataset (heart.csv) using pd.read_csv.
b)Saved dataset into Excel format using df.to_excel().
c)Extracted a single column (chol) and computed:Mean,Maximum,Minimum,Standard Deviation.

TASK-2:Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
OBJECTIVE:To Visualize Numerical Data for better understanding of distribution and patterns.
VISUALIZATIONS PERFORMED:a)Line Graph b)Bar Graph c)Scatter Plot d)Density Plot e)Violin Plot f)Box Plot

TASK-3:Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
OBJECTIVE:To Reduce Dimensions and Identify Principal Components.
WORK DONE:
a)Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the dataset.
b)Extracted and plotted PC1 and PC2.
